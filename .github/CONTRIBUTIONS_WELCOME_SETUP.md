# Setting Up Contributions Welcome on GitHub

> **📖 For a comprehensive guide covering ALL GitHub communities, see [GITHUB_COMMUNITIES_GUIDE.md](GITHUB_COMMUNITIES_GUIDE.md)**

This guide will help you get this repository to appear on GitHub's [contributions-welcome](https://github.com/topics/contributions-welcome) topic page.

## ✅ Requirements Checklist

GitHub requires these items for a repository to appear under `contributions-welcome`:

- [x] **Public repository** ✅ (Already done)
- [x] **CONTRIBUTING.md file** ✅ (Already exists)
- [x] **Open source license** ✅ (MIT License present)
- [ ] **Topic: `contributions-welcome`** ❌ (Need to add on GitHub)
- [ ] **At least one issue with `good first issue` or `help wanted` label** ❌ (Need to create)

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Add the Topic (REQUIRED)

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/khaleedbinaziz1/open-stack-js
2. Click on the **⚙️ Settings** tab (top navigation)
3. Scroll down to the **Topics** section (in the left sidebar or on the settings page)
4. Click **Edit** or the edit icon next to "Topics"
5. Add these topics:
   - `contributions-welcome` (REQUIRED)
   - `open-source`
   - `nextjs`
   - `typescript`
   - `learning-platform`
   - `fullstack`
   - `web-development`
6. Click **Save** or press Enter

**⚠️ Without the `contributions-welcome` topic, your repo will NOT appear on the page.**

### Step 2: Create Issues with Labels (REQUIRED)

You need at least ONE issue with either the `good first issue` or `help wanted` label.

#### Option A: Use GitHub Issue Templates (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/khaleedbinaziz1/open-stack-js/issues
2. Click **New issue**
3. You'll see templates:
   - **Good First Issue** - For beginner-friendly tasks
   - **Help Wanted** - For features that need community help
4. Select a template and fill it out
5. **Important**: Make sure the labels `good first issue` and/or `help wanted` are automatically added (they should be based on the template)

#### Option B: Create Issues Manually

1. Go to: https://github.com/khaleedbinaziz1/open-stack-js/issues/new
2. Create issues like these examples:

**Example 1: Good First Issue**
- **Title**: `[Good First Issue] Improve README structure and add table of contents`
- **Labels**: `good first issue`, `help wanted`
- **Description**: 
  ```
  This is a beginner-friendly task to improve the README.
  
  Tasks:
  - Add a table of contents
  - Improve section formatting
  - Add more installation details
  - Fix any typos or grammar issues
  ```

**Example 2: Help Wanted**
- **Title**: `[Help Wanted] Add new technology guide for [Technology Name]`
- **Labels**: `help wanted`
- **Description**: 
  ```
  Add a new visual learning guide for [technology].
  
  This would involve:
  - Creating the guide page
  - Adding code examples
  - Creating concept cards
  - Adding to navigation
  ```

**Example 3: UI Improvement**
- **Title**: `[Good First Issue] Improve accessibility and responsive design`
- **Labels**: `good first issue`, `help wanted`
- **Description**: 
  ```
  Improve the accessibility and mobile responsiveness of the platform.
  
  Tasks:
  - Add ARIA labels
  - Improve color contrast
  - Fix mobile layout issues
  - Add keyboard navigation support
  ```

### Step 3: Verify Labels Are Applied

**⚠️ Labels are case-sensitive!** They must be exactly:
- `good first issue` (not "Good First Issue" or "good-first-issue")
- `help wanted` (not "Help Wanted" or "help-wanted")

To check:
1. Go to any issue
2. Look at the labels on the right side
3. If labels don't exist, create them first:
   - Go to: https://github.com/khaleedbinaziz1/open-stack-js/labels
   - Click **New label**
   - Create: `good first issue` (green color recommended)
   - Create: `help wanted` (blue color recommended)

2. Search for `open-stack-js` or `khaleedbinaziz1`
3. Your repository should appear in the list!

## 🚀 Pro Tips for Maximum Visibility

1. **Create multiple issues** - Repos with 3-5 `good first issue` labels rank higher
2. **Keep issues updated** - Close completed ones and add new ones regularly
3. **Respond to contributors** - Active maintainers get more visibility
4. **Share on social media** - Let people know you're looking for contributors
5. **Update README** - The badge we added helps with discoverability

## 📝 Notes

- The `contributions-welcome` topic is the **most important** requirement
- Labels must match GitHub's standard naming (case-sensitive)
- Public repo, CONTRIBUTING.md, and license are already in place ✅
- Issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` will make creating issues easier
